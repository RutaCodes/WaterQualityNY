# ANALYZING CONTAMINANTS OF EMERGING CONCERN (CECs)

**Environmental and Spatial Variables Influencing Contaminants of Emerging Concern in Watersheds Across Central NY**

Monitoring studies have identified the occurrence of hundreds of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) throughout water, sediments and biota. The presence of CECs
is often associated with degraded water quality, which can be harmful to ecosystems and human health. Despite their ubiquitous presence, relatively few studies
explore how environment and land-use affect CEC occurrence, which obscures our understanding of spatio-temporal influences and the ultimate fate of these chemicals in 
natural systems. We combined temporal sampling with expanded spatial scales, which provided a unique opportunity to study influences on CEC transport at regional 
scales and to identify overarching CEC behavior patterns. Our analysis centers around central New York where we sampled twenty mixed-use watersheds throughout 2018 
and 2019 during late spring and early fall across diverse hydrologic and environmental conditions. To establish spatio-temporal CEC patterns, grab samples were 
collected during two rounds of sampling each year, which were taken 20 to 25 days apart. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass 
spectrometry and quantified with reference standards producing CEC concentrations. A total of 79 CECs were identified including various pharmaceuticals, personal 
care products, and pesticides. CEC concentrations were analyzed using Spearman correlation analysis and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) models to tease out relationships 
between temporal compound occurrences, differences among sites, and environmental factors driving these variances. Our results show that in addition to varying water 
quality levels among different sites, CEC behavior is highly variable among compounds, with variability being correlated with different streamflow and precipitation 
variables. In addition, we show that different proportions of land cover (e.g., whole watershed versus sampling location) can be highly useful in predicting number of 
detected compounds as well as their concentrations using percentage of urban and agricultural land cover. These findings are useful not only in developing data-driven 
CEC modeling but also in informing future mitigations and monitoring strategies, which are essential in protecting surface water quality today and into the future.
