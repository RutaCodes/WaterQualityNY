**FOLDERS:**

*CEC_CorrelationAnalysis* - correlation analysis used to study co-occurance patterns among detected compounds as well as samples.

*EnvironmentalData* - correlation analysis used to analyze relationship between environmental variables and detected compound concentrations.

*SpatialAnaysis* - code that was used to predict the number as well as compound concentrations using watershed land cover.

*Other* - analysis code that was not used in the final paper.

**FILES:** 

*CEC_initial_analysis.R* - initial analysis of 90 water samples from 22 sites in upstate New York. Note that the main file used in this code reporting detected CEC concentrations (*CEC_info.csv*) is not shared here as this work is still undergoing peer review and will be published in the future.

*CEC_use.csv* - information about contaminants that were found in samples. 

*Study_sites.md* -information about sampling locations and associated study watersheds.
