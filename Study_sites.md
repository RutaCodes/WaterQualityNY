# Study Sites

To analyze CEC dynamics in various sites, our study focuses on sampling across twenty watersheds located in central New York.

All watersheds but two contain at least one USGS stream gage providing current, continuous streamflow monitoring. Selected sampling locations are in close proximity 
to USGS stream gages ensuring streamflow data availability. All study sites are in mixed-use watersheds with varying levels of urban, forested, and agricultural land 
cover. These characteristics are listed below, along with three-letter abbreviations of watershed names, used throughout the rest of the study. A few watersheds
have a predominant land use type, which differentiates them from the rest. Harbor Brook (HAR) is the only watershed that is predominantly urban (48.8%). Three 
watersheds (SAL, OAT, FLI), are dominated by agricultural land use (54.1%, 48.5%, and 43.5%, respectively), while three study watersheds are primarily forested 
(SCR, 66.6%; OTS, 66.3%; SIX, 64.6%).
